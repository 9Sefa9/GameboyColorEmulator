# GameboyColorEmulator

Creating another Gameboy or Gameboy Color emulator is not needed since there are several versions out there which covers nearly all aspects of emulation for the Gameboy hardware. However, to evolve and strengthen my current development skills, i thought that this repository would be a very good opportunity.
Time by time i update this readme file. Contribution is not permitted since this is a project which i want to do it on my own.  This includes researching the hardware architecture, programming techniques and scientific way of thinking and applying information.
